# Heart Sensor Simulation

This Processing sketch will help you simulate a heartbeat sensor by sending an OSC message ever time a heartbeat is detected on an audio stream. You can use the supplied audio stream or you can record your own heart and replace the existing recording, then tweak the sensitivity of the detector.

This will prevent you from having to wait for progress in your design if you do no have a heartbeat sensor at hand.
